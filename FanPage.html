    <h2>
        Bio
    </h2>

    <p>
        Mutemath (sometimes styled as MuteMath or MUTEMATH) is an American alternative rock band from New Orleans that formed in 2002. The group consists of lead vocalist and keyboardist Paul Meany, drummer Darren King, guitarist Todd Gummerman, and bassist Jonathan Allen, but they often perform on any mixture or variation of these instruments. They draw heavily from influences in 1960s and 1970s soul, psychedelic rock, and jam band styles, utilizing vintage guitars and amplifiers, as well as Rhodes keyboards, synthesizers, and other electronic instruments such as the keytar.
